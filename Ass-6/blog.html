        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold underline my-2">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const:</h2>
        <p><span class="font-bold underline">var:</span> The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It means variables defined outside the
            function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within
            the function.</p>
        <p><span class="font-bold underline">let:</span> The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can't be accessible outside the particular block
            ({block}). Let's see the below example.</p>
        <p><span class="font-bold underline">const:</span> The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot
            update it. When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error.
            The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold underline my-2">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
        <p>Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. The variable which has
            been assigned as null contains no value. Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been declared,
            but its value has not been assigned.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold underline my-2">What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
        <p>RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet.
            Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform
            various tasks. For example, to generate monthly payslips, your internal accounts system has to share data
            with your customer's banking system to automate invoicing and communicate with an internal timesheet
            application. RESTful APIs support this information exchange because they follow secure, reliable, and
            efficient software communication standards.</p>
